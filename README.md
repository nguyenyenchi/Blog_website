This repo stores the files I used to build my first personal [website](https://nguyenyenchicom.netlify.app/) for blogging.

## Start
This project was started thanks to:

- My love for building my own blog where I can share my learnings in my life and data science journey to others.
- My chance to practice HTML & CSS I learned at uni.
- My preference to write posts in Markdown.
## Implementation
The creation of this personal blog site was inspired by and credited to [Kevin Powell's personal blog projects](https://github.com/kevin-powell/JAMStack-blog-starter#).

During the process, I've learnt to:

- Build simple web pages with HTML & CSS.
- Use Eleventy as a Static Site Generator to create the site based on pre-created templates.
- Use Netlify CMS to manage site content.
## Fin
This site has been built with interesting struggles, which means so much fun as I've learnt a lot. Let's get started on blogging and sharing!ðŸŒˆ
