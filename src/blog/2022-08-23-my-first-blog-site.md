# Start 
This project was started thanks to:
- My love for building my own blog where I can share my data learning journey and other interests to others
- My chance to practice HTML & CSS I learned at uni
- My preference to write posts in Markdown

# Implementation
The creation of this personal blog site was inspired by and credited to [Kevin Powell's personal blog projects](https://github.com/kevin-powell/JAMStack-blog-starter#).

During the process, I've learnt to:
- Build simple web pages with HTML & CSS
- Use Eleventy as a Static Site Generator to create the site based on pre-created templates
- Use Netlify CMS to manage site content

# Fin
This site has been built with interesting struggles, which means so much fun as I've learnt a lot. Let's get started on blogging and sharing!ðŸŒˆ
