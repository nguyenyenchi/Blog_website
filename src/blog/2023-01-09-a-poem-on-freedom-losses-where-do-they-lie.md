We all crave successes,\
money, career, relationships\
are they our own, or something less?\
Our dreams, desires, ambitions\
don't you mind where they came from?\
time will come when you have to confess\
what do you want them to be?\
you have to choose, the wins, the losses\
Hurry, seek now from within\
own your dreams and goals\
ask not others but your own soul\
what's calling you the hint\
what's even bolder, prettier\
than your true self be seen
