description: What keeps you going?

Today, I had the chance to share the recent records of my learnings and my take on procrastination and motivation with a friend, and later felt happy to know that my sharing is beneficial to her in some way.

That’s when I have another boost of motivation. It encourages me to keep up my learning, keep paying attention, and keep on sharing. I now know better that regardless of how much the story entails, there will be someone in this world who might benefit from it. Even if you haven’t seen it that way, even if you haven’t known any person who might see it helpful, keep on learning and sharing. This first step counts, the initial effort matters.

One share, in a way, is how much motivation costs.
