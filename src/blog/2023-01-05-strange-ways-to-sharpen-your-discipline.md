**1. Skilling up is winning over yourself**

* If you are able to maintain your habits that you want in your life everyday, if you are able to make improvements, you're winning. The victory is over your past self, and that's the most precious win you can attain. 

**2.** **Past days' sunk costs are high if you give up**

* Once you get some exercise in routinely, or eat healthily for several days in a row, remember to tell yourself to keep going, as if you give up now, you're losing all of those days, time, and efforts that you've put in to maintain the habits. Try a bit more, stay there a bit longer. Wouldn't it be fun to see the number of days, workouts, coding exercises that you've done go up day after day? Wouldn't it be cool to see how far longer you can build this habit, how many more days you can keep challenging yourself? Make the crosses in your calendar keep showing up.

**3.** **Hear your model's criticism**

* If someone you really admire and look up to said that he despised people who didn't make an effort to live better, what would you think? "Despise" sounds like a strong word, but there is an intention behind that person's word as a prolific writer. If you feel angry, probably you should find another role model. If you feel something uncomfortable inside you like I did, you will start feeling that it's hard to hear as it's the truth. What he said is true. And so you might imagine one day meeting the person that you really respect, and actually start being the person that he would also respect.

**4.** **Small % each day really counts** 

* One to two push-ups per day, three more minutes of doing exercises, a few more time of writing or working on that project,... Keep doing the little things that you know will contribute to you achieving the goals you set out. And one day, you might be amazed at how strong your shoulder is that you can easily do a wheel pose right in the first try. Big sense of pride follows I guarantee!

**5. If you want to be the example to someone you love**

* Mahatma Gandhi wisely said: "Be the change you wish to see in the world." If you want to see improvements in your beloved ones' lives and your surroundings, remember that the change starts with you. Can you tell someone you love to do something that you don't even do? Your thoughts, and actions are the starting points. Start being the example. Start leading the people around you to more beautiful and better places.

**6. Really get to know the habits you're building**

* Once you really understand why you want to sleep early, why sleeping is so crucial to your health, what the many benefits of a good sleep are, how a healthy sleep strengthens your ability to learn and recharge, it's hard to resist not trying to build and incorporate that important habit in your life. Get your studies done, enhance your knowledge about the areas you want improvements in, and you're off to a good start.

Happy to hear other weird ways to keep building self-discipline that you have. 

Cheers,
