Remember the joy of programming:
- when you successfully write the classes to call a REST API service, even though you don't think you could do it in the beginning as you haven't done it before and it might take ages.
- when you could finally understand what the documentation is "whispering" to you, and your experimenting with writing codes and printing results in the terminal finally bear fruit.
- when your mind naturally thinks about the problems you haven't solved at work on the bus ride back home, and you suddenly see the light! Or a beam of light, haha. Regardless of how faint it might be, it helps!
- when you find, and "destroy" that bug once and for all! And maybe still let some survive!
- when you're so happy to get the help from your mentors and teammates that enables you to skill up, and contribute.

Remember the joy of doing yoga:
- when you get to learn new yoga poses. Even better, when you successfully perform the new one for the first time!
- when you get to do a new yoga pose and experience how hard it is, how fun it is, how challenging it is, and how relaxing it is.
- when you get to do the challenging pose and laugh at yourself for failing at it.
- when you fall asleep during the last few minutes of relaxation, and even snore without knowledge. 
- when you feel really in love with yoga as your teacher teaches yoga with love, and your classmates also enjoy doing yoga as much as you do.

If only you could notice the moments you smile, feel happy, laugh out loud whenever you do something. It's much easier to keep up the efforts that way. Gradually, things will become less of a demanding struggle, a sad resistance, and more of an automatic action, a happy habit. 

Let's find and keep the laughter coming in the things we do.
