When I was learning Streamlit to build the [30-Second Habit app](https://github.com/nguyenyenchi/30-Second-Habit-App), I struggled with session state and callback functions. I watched several YouTube videos and read the [documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features/session-state) which explained the concepts. The communication is clear, I understood everything. Or so I thought! It turned out that when I wanted to use these features in my app, they didn't work as intended. I fell into the trap of the illusion of knowledge, thinking I understand something when I actually don't.

Later, I figured out a solution.

Instead of letting myself mindlessly absorb large amount of information all at once and passively, I now learn theories bit by bit with practice. I break them down by watching only one video or reading one article at a time, then follow the examples and code right afterwards to understand how the features work. In this way, I've learnt to understand each component of the features more properly and systematically, which later allowed me to use them logically and flexibly in my app.
