# Start
This app was built with Streamlit and takes the inspiration from an Essentialist practice introduced in Greg McKeown's [blog](https://gregmckeown.com/30-second-habit-lifelong-impact/) 
in which you spend 30 seconds writing down the most 
important points after every experience, meeting or event.
