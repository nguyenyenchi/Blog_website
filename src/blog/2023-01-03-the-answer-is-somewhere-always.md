On coding practice

Some lessons I learned recently about programming include:

* Look closely enough at the documentation, and you find out the paths to make the codes run and produce some outputs
* If you get frustrated or tired, stand up, take a walk, have a drink, then come back. Your mind works much better when it's not under stress, worries, or pressure
* Ask for help from others for some pointers, then you might see the light
* There are two main problems you will face when programming: either your algorithms-the steps you plan out to solve the problem are incorrect, or the syntax is incorrect. Don't stress out because of the latter whenever you learn a new programming language, as the first is far more important, and many languages share the same basic concepts. Get your algorithm right, get through the basic concepts, really understand them, then move on to master more complex ones 
* Keep finding new ways to search for the results you expect, as it's definitely somewhere! All you need to put in are time, efforts, patience, and perseverance

Programming never ceases to challenge me, and that's why I keep coming back to it again and again, though many times I would be pulling my hair, doubting myself, or laughing at myself real hard to blow off steam. That image is fun, and programming is indeed so much fun, I guarantee.

So keep making IT work! Good luck!
