    <p><strong>Things I know for sure up to now</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Every day is a gift.
Every day I get to rise, spend time with myself, talk to my family and friends.
I get to learn new things, and reflect on what I've learnt.
I get to lead my life the way I want, stumble across new opportunities, accept those opportunities, and voila, I'm embarking on exciting new adventures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Good things take time.
Nothing worthwhile, precious, valuable is free. It takes efforts, consistency, and persistence to get what I desire most in my life. There is no shortcut. It's like a constant variable you put on top of a programming file. It takes time. I don't know when I can make it, whatever my heart desires, whatever goal I set for myself, but I know for sure that definitely I can do it, one day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learning about myself is of utmost importance.
Before I didn't know what it means by &quot;learning about yourself.&quot; It sounds like a strange concept or question to ask someone. Of course, I know myself. I know myself the best. But nope. In my younger years, someone once said to me it seemed like you never looked at yourself in the mirror and asked what you wanted to do in your life. I guess we will all come to that stage in our life sooner or later, not knowing where we are in this big big world. But gradually, with knowledge acquisition, self-awareness, and self-reflection, I know what I love dearly, what depletes my energy, what fuels my passion, and motivation, and what keeps me going. The fun thing is this journey never ends, and I can't wait to see what and who is waiting for me as I keep moving forward.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I write my own stories.
What is my way of doing things in this world? If it works for me, no matter how different or strange it is in others' eyes, I won't care. Why? Because everyone's path is different. Everyone is unique, has their own special stories to tell the world, has their own struggles they need to overcome daily. Everyone is on a journey to live a better and happier life, don't they? Everyone deserves a daily compliment for shining and creating magic in their own life, and the life of others around them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moving forward: My current stories</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Money &amp; Time Management</strong></p>
<p>To have a budget of how I should spend and save money, and to have a schedule of when I do certain things serves two purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a portion in place I put aside to spend money on necessary things, and spend time on necessary tasks, enabling me to live a healthy, responsible life.</li>
<li>The other portion of my money and time is for me to spend for myself, living according to the &quot;pay yourself first&quot; principle. That budget and schedule are protecting my &quot;cherished desires&quot;, goals, and dreams from &quot;casual wishes.&quot; [1] As time is limited, a scarce resource. We all want to do so many things, yet it always feels like there is too little time. The cures? Pick what you desire the most, and ignore the rest.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Discipline</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I tell myself that there are things that are &quot;non-negotiables&quot; [2], for example, getting a good night sleep, doing daily exercise, eating healthily, learning everyday.</li>
<li>Procrastination, funnily, can be thought of as my enemy, one that I so eagerly want to defeat. It will frequently comes to visit whenever I struggle to do something, feel I suck big time at something, and doubt my ability. It will take away my opportunities to &quot;meet the Goddess of good luck&quot; [1] if I don't act. For example, when the time comes to do exercise, if I don't do it, I'm letting the &quot;Procrastinator&quot; [1] deprive myself of the opportunity to keep fit and live a healthier life, one that I won't regret when I get older.
When the time comes for me to learn new things, review and reflect on my previous learnings, if I don't do it, again, the &quot;Procrastinator&quot; is freely taking away my opportunity to grow, pursue my deepest desires and goals.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Next step</strong></p>
<p>I will keep experimenting. Isn't it amazing to keep figuring out the truths?</p>
