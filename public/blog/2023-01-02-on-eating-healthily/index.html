    <p><strong>Wï»¿hy eating healthily is important</strong>?</p>
<ol>
<li>Without a healthy body and mind, you can easily feel tired</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>No or less good work is the result. Only when you have a healthy body and mind can you be in the best state of mind to learn, focus, and produce work of values.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>You're taking care of your present and future self</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>It's like investing. If you don't care for your body and mind now with a balanced, and healthy diet, you can't reap the rewards of a healthy body and mind as the years pass, and sign of aging appears.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>You're taking care of your loved ones</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Taking care of yourself well by eating healthily is the same with you taking care of your loved ones. Will you give your parents the junk food that you give to yourself?</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li>Nutritious food is energy for the brain</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Healthy food is the source of power for your brain to function properly. If the intake of nutritions is insufficient, probably you will experience soon a tired mind, a sluggish body, an aching leg.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is it really hard to eat healthily?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Actually it's not. The amount of time I spend cooking for 2-3 meals is approximately only 45 minutes normally. During that time, I also get to listen to music or an audible book, which is a huge plus of time-saving!</li>
<li>All good things coming together helps, regardless of how little they are. Eating healthily 80% of the time, doing exercise, trying to sleep early, reducing the amount of social media hours daily-all come together in helping you get to where you want to direct your focus and attention, and eventually where you want to be in your life. Bit by bit helps, and with practice, patience, and a flexible mindset to adapt and change, you can definitely figure out the routines that fits you and your goals.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Practice what you learn</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You know all about the benefits of a healthy diet, a good meal with sufficient nutritions. Yet, you haven't been able to incorporate them into your daily life. Thus, there is a sense of guilt. You feel like you haven't done your best. You feel like being defeated as you haven't figured out a way to live a better life and take a better care of yourself. You feel like there is an area in your life that you haven't quite mastered. But it's alright. As writing these down is the first step. Examining your behaviours matters and plays an important role in curving your thought to the right direction.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Something certain</strong>
In the same way that you've been able to do exercise and write gratitude journal daily, or reduce entertainment time, gradually you will figure out the way to build the habits of having healthy meals regularly, of not skipping meals or thinking that you're still young, fit and strong, of not fully understanding the many benefits of a heathy eating habit, or of the many consequences of an unhealthy one. I'm sure you will get there, one day. Keep up the practice. Protect your body and mind to stay focus, and do good work. Protect your future self.</p>
