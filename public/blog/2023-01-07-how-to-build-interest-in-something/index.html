    <p>Thu Giang Nguyen Duy Can, in his book &quot;I self learn,&quot; proposed that a person's persistent effort is contributed by one's own interest. If you're deeply interested in something, your studies, work, exercises, no matter how hard or challenging they are, you don't feel the struggles, tiredness, or in the worse case, less of it. So how does a person build and sustain interest to continue on their learning journey? The first solution: Curiosity about your original ideas.</p>
<p>In his book &quot;The discerning mind,&quot; Thu Giang Nguyen Duy Can mentioned that when you want to find out the answers to a problem, puzzle, or research about a topic, you probably have some ideas about it already, through your experience, books, or social media. Curiosity then acts as a motivator for you to seek further knowledge and find out the evidence to support those ideas.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you want to build new healthy eating habits, and you remember hearing somewhere that a plant-based diet is the way to go. You then become curious and motivated to find more resources to confirm or reject your belief, and eventually make the decision. Thus, to build the interest in a topic, start with the ideas, assumptions, or beliefs you already have. You will then naturally become curious to read books, watch videos, or find credible resources to extend your knowledge. Further interest about the topic will be built as you go along the searching process.</p>
<p>Another way that I'm experimenting with is to ask questions about the topic that I'm interested in. â€‹For example, I want to build and sustain my interest in learning to program, and become a competent programmer in the current internship program that I'm in. I asked myself: &quot;What are some original ideas or questions that I can have about this goal, so that I'm motivated by my curiosity to keep working toward my goal?&quot; I can ask myself questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>How further can I go to explore my potential in this field?</li>
<li>What problems can I solve by myself?</li>
<li>To what extent will I put my time and efforts in this to skill up?</li>
<li>What can I actually build if my programming skills are improved?</li>
<li>What does the final product look like? What can be the best version of the final product?</li>
<li>What possibilities are there for programmers and developers to contribute to making the world a better place with their skills?</li>
</ul>
<p>I know that I have some answers for the above questions, or at least some expectations from myself for them. And I believe that these questions have already triggered my curious mind and self-motivation to either find out the answers, or make the answers I want of myself become the reality.</p>
