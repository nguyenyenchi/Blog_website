    <p>As a new student with a commerce background decided to study IT, I have had several moments of self-doubt in the beginning.</p>
<p>&quot;Can I solve this problem?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How to make sense of this learning material?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Will I be able to survive this subject?&quot; :D</p>
<p>Overtime, I’ve learnt that it’s crucial to be objective instead of questioning my abilities and potentials. Difficulties might be the results of several factors such as new study environment, new friends who have previous experience in the IT industry, new expectations as a newcomer and a woman in IT, … Among them, new study materials intrigue me the most, but at the same time never cease to challenge me.</p>
<p>One thing that has helped me overcome self-doubt when learning new things in IT is what called “the curse of knowledge.” <sup>1</sup> Put simply, when I don’t understand something that the teachers say, instead of thinking badly about myself, I’d think that it’s possible the teacher doesn’t deliver the content in a way that sticks with my existing knowledge, or a novice’s existing knowledge, because teachers or experts suffer from the curse of knowledge. They can’t unlearn what they already know. They can’t see the blank canvas that new students see.</p>
<p>And so I’d be on my way seeking answers from external sources like textbooks, YouTube videos, blog posts, … As I read more about the topic, I understand more, know better. Keep learning, in a way is about keep looking for answers to questions about why you haven’t figured this out, how you can learn differently, how to make things stick to you.</p>
<p>Keep finding new ways!</p>
