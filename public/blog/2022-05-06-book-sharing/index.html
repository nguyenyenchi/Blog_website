    <p>Recently I’ve read the book titled “Four Thousand Weeks - Time Management for Mortals” written by Oliver Burkeman. The praises for the book from several writers include: “This is the most important book ever written about time management.” (Adam Grant), “It invites nothing less than a new relationship with time – and with life itself.” (Krista Tippett), or “Oliver Burkeman provides an important and insightful reassessment of productivity” (Cal Newport). The book is indeed like how it was praised, and much more.
Before and during reading this book, I’ve hoped that it will help me answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which time management technique will enable me to do all the things that I want to do?</li>
<li>Why do I feel like everything matters, and that I can do them all? Self-care, relationships, study, work, social impact?</li>
<li>How to cultivate patience?</li>
<li>Why is there discomfort even in the things I want to do?</li>
<li>How can I live more in the present?</li>
</ul>
<p>And… so many more. The more I read, the more questions I have, the more answers I encounter, the more things to ponder. Many times, I was surprised, relieved, happy, sad, and grateful for what the writer has shared into this world.
It’s no fun to write more about what the book entails but to read. Hope that this recommendation is helpful to those who have different or similar questions about time.</p>
