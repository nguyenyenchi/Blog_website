    <p>Recently I've completed the 1st challenge and half way through the 2nd one in the 8-Week SQL Challenge created by Danny Ma. Besides enhancing my analytical skills with PostgreSQL in the areas of</p>
<ul>
<li>Data exploration</li>
<li>Duplicates</li>
<li>Summary statistics</li>
<li>Table joins</li>
<li>Window functions</li>
</ul>
<p>I've also learned the importance of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Document my learnings in Markdown files.</li>
<li>Understand that the language is just a tool. Fine, you can learn, remember and know as many functions as you want like the back of your hand. I have news for you: The thinking and how to solve the problem is far more important. But the good news is: We can get to this stage with ongoing practice.</li>
<li>Self-doubt will no doubt appear and try to take you down, but you need to keep going.</li>
<li>Gradually I learn to avoid the pitfalls: Sometimes it is about how unfamiliar weâ€™re with the materials presented or the teaching styles. Everyone has their own learning styles, so itâ€™s important to know what our ones are to leverage them.</li>
<li>Sometimes I learned too fast without remembering the basics. Struggling to get the syntax right will lead to no flow and frustration, thinking my memory sucks. This thinking can easily make me go down hill! But memory can be a choice. Iâ€™ve been using Anki flashcards as an attempt to overcome this issue. The result of this learning method guarantees a future post.</li>
<li>Writing down the questions and puzzles I have through each step of the problem has helped me to question my thinking, find holes in it and eventually find the solution.</li>
<li>Knowing that I need to take a break, come back the next day, and feel happy about my sudden Eureka moment. How amazingly our brain works!</li>
</ul>
<p>Reflection works, for future learning to come ðŸŽ‰</p>
