    <p><strong>To laugh</strong>.</p>
<p>Laughter helps me to</p>
<ul>
<li>look on the brighter and funnier side of things</li>
<li>look at my problems in an interestingly, cunningly, craftily, scarily humorous way</li>
<li>reduce the stress</li>
<li>have some fun during working hours</li>
<li>diffuse the tension in difficult conversations</li>
<li>tell someone an ugly or harsh truth without making them feel too bad</li>
<li>bring the smiles to someone else's face</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To accept things for what they are</strong></p>
<p>&quot;It is what it is.&quot; It means:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accepting the facts, and seeking the truth. No matter how much you want to come back in time to fix a mistake, for example, know that there is no point in it. The only way is to accept it, learn the lesson, think of ways to solve the problems, and update your working styles or processes so that you reduce the chances of making the same mistake again in the future.</li>
<li>Welcoming things as they happen. If unfortunate event'd occur, if you'd lose a tournament, if someone'd unintentionally say something that could be said in a much nicer way, accept that in life things happen, move on, let it go.</li>
<li>Seeing the nature of things and all of its components. Getting stuck in traffic jam on the way to work is the gem of living in a big city, while experiencing heavy storms in the rainy season is the diamond of living in a distant tropical city. Pick the city that is your home, say your short, lovely complaints, and enjoy the best moments of it.</li>
<li>Letting people or things go when it's no longer working out. This quote from the movie &quot;(500) Days of Summer&quot; best summarises this: &quot;People change. Feelings change. It doesn't mean that the love once shared wasn't true and real. It simply means that sometimes when people grow, they grow apart.&quot;</li>
</ul>
