    <p><strong>1﻿. Laugh</strong></p>
<p>O﻿ne way to be free from your worries is to try laughing at the troubles or problems that you're facing. Make it fun. Tell your mind that this is interestingly challenging, beautifully scary, sorrowly fascinating. Imagine you're starring in a comedy action movie, full of laughter and adventure. Imagine algorithm is your old-time enemy, and now it's your time to fight and master it once and for all. How fun is that?</p>
<p><strong>2﻿. Journal</strong></p>
<p>W﻿riting down your thoughts will help you clear up the mind, get your thinking straight, and make you realise things you haven't thought of before. Somewhere in that line of thought, you might come across the solution to your problem.</p>
<p><strong>3﻿. Talk to someone</strong></p>
<p>F﻿amily, friends and colleagues are among your greatest supporters in this world. Go to them, seek help and comfort. They might not have the solution to your troubles, but they can give you new perspective, and different way of thinking to detensify.</p>
<p><strong>4﻿. Go for a walk</strong></p>
<p>T﻿he vast space in the nature will remind you that you or the problem you're facing is actually a really small part of the world. There is so much more out there that might need more of your attention.</p>
<p><strong>5﻿. Believe in yourself</strong></p>
<p>Positive self-talk and self-encouragement will help to keep you going, motivate you to keep trying, and remind you of the values that will eventually help you figure out the solution. Remember, there is always an answer to the problem you're having. There is always a solution, if we keep moving forward, putting in our time and efforts, and not giving up.</p>
<p><strong>6﻿. Read</strong></p>
<p>W﻿hether it's a book, a blog, or a newspaper, find the resources that might give you the solution. Keep looking and be patient. The answer is definitely somewhere!</p>
<p><strong>7﻿. Remind yourself of all the &quot;stress-training&quot;</strong></p>
<p>W﻿e've all been there - sitting exams, going to an interview, engaging in difficult conversation, taking driving lessons,... You've been through even more stressful situations, and you survived it. You did it. And now you're here, taking on more challenges because you know that what you do matters. Of course, come with challenges will be the worries, self-doubts, stresses. But you've been through similar situations before. At the end, it's all a test-a training for you to learn better, to develop, to grow.</p>
